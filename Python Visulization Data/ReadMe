## How to Use
1. Open the `.txt` files to see code examples and instructions.  
2. Use the corresponding `.csv` files as input data for the visualizations.  
3. Follow the instructions in `.txt` files to reproduce the charts or analyses.  

> Tip: If you want to run the code directly, consider renaming `.txt` files to `.py`.
